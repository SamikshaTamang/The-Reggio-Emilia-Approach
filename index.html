				<h2>Reggio Emilia Approach</h2>
				<h5>History</h5>
				<p>"Learning and teaching should not stand on opposite sides of a river and just watch it
					flow by; instead, they should go on a journey down the river together. Teaching how to
					learn may be strengthened through an active, reciprocal exchange."<br>
					- Lorris Malaguzzi</p>

				<p><br>
					The Reggio Emilia Approach has a lengthy history that begins in the mid-nineteenth century
					and unfolds over time in a succession of important events. The Reggio Emilia philosophy's unique
					origins resulted in a highly unusual and creative approach to early childhood education. Criticisms of
					the educational system erupted in Italy following World War II (Santn and Torruella, 2017). This is
					where the Reggio Emilia method was born. This educational viewpoint was named after the
					municipality of Reggio Emilia, located in the Emilia Romagna region of Northern Italy. People in the
					community of Villa Cella, near Reggio Emilia, chose to establish a school on their own in 1945. After
					hearing about the development, Loris Malaguzzi, a young teacher, arrived in the area. The Reggio
					Emilia method began to take shape around this time. In 1968, the Italian government funded Reggio
					Emilia schools (YAŞAR and PAMUK, 2020).<br><br>
					The technique influenced many theorists who were specialists in philosophy and pedagogy
					because of its adaptability and flexibility. Reggio Emilia was profoundly woven into the fabric of the
					local government, society, and people when it was founded. Loris Malaguzzi felt that a fresh and
					innovative approach to education would help children. This community-oriented Reggio Emilia
					method of learning aimed to develop distinct personalities in children throughout their early years
					where they can communicate their thoughts and interests in various ways (Edwards and Gandini,
					2018). Therefore, Loris Malaguzzi is the father of the Reggio Emilia approach. This one-of-a-kind
					technique has evolved into one of the top educational programmes for young children over many
					decades. Since then, Reggio Emilia and the Reggio Emilia Approach have been in contact with over
					145 nations and territories worldwide (Reggio Emilia Approach, n.d.).

				<h5>Theoretical Underpinnings</h5>
				<p>The philosophy of Reggio Emilia is founded on social constructivist ideas, which characterize
					children as active social agents who create and determine their social lives. Malaguzzi (1993) claims
					that children are far from passive learners who lack frameworks and social processes. John Dewey's
					progressive education movement influenced the Reggio Emilia method. Malaguzzi built his theory
					and philosophy of early childhood education through direct practice in schools for infants, toddlers,
					and pre-schoolers (Edwards and Gandhini, 2018). Bruno Ciari, John Dewey, Jean Piaget, and Lev
					Vygotsky are the most significant theorists of the Reggio Emilia approach. Each theorist has their
					view and assumptions on this approach. Lev Vygotsky emphasized that learning happens through
					contact between adults and children. Adults give social advice and modelling to children as more
					skilled and mature participants in the learning investment, facilitating the development of both their
					cognitive and social processes. Jean Piaget is more concerned with a child's cognitive development.
					Piaget regarded intellectual and cognitive disputes as developing higher order thinking and
					establishing authority for learning in social situations ((YAŞAR and PAMUK, 2020). <br><br>
					As held by John Dewey, the Reggio Emilia approach's assumption highlighted the significance
					of cognition and social contact in the development of the learning process. The heart of the learning
					process was experience and investigation. According to John Dewey's 'progressive education'
					concept, cooperation in learning occurs when both teachers and students engage and participate in
					the educational process. He believed that if instructors allowed students to generate knowledge
					from their discoveries, they would develop an inner passion for studying. In the Italian town of
					Reggio Emilia, Bruno Ciari was possibly the most significant figure in establishing an interactionism
					school system. Ciari has advocated for an education system that promotes the development of the
					complete child since the early 1950s. In addition, he placed a more considerable emphasis on
					increased community engagement in education, in which parents, teachers, and other people
					participate in open discourse about all elements of education (Santn and Torruella, 2017).</p>

				<h5>Curriculum Ideologies</h5>
				<p>"Our point of arrival is to create a beloved school that is productive, imaginative,
					liveable, documentable, and communicative, a site of research, learning, re-cognition,
					and reflection, where children, teachers, and families feel at ease."<br>
					- Lorris Malaguzzi</p>

				<p>The esteem and potential of the Reggio approach: Improving learning and educating<br></p>
					<dl>
					<dt><p>1. The emergent curriculum and a project-based approach:</p><br></dt>
					<dd><p>The Reggio method emphasizes a child-led curriculum that evolves from the
					children's interests and ideas and is produced through constant negotiation
					between children, teachers, and parents. Teachers can use an emergent
					curriculum to support project work that allows students to dig deeper into their
					areas of interest. Children are encouraged to take charge of their education and
					pursue their interests, building on their existing knowledge, skills, and preferred
					learning styles while receiving help to expand their learning capacity and
					versatility. A project-based approach to learning experiences emphasizes the
					significance of 'learning by doing,' where children are given the time, space, and
					materials they need to explore, research, and develop their interests (Arseven,
					2014).</p></dd>
					<dt><p>2. Collaboration and Relationship:</p></dt>
					<dd><P>Learning is considered a dynamic, social co-construction process built on
					interactions and connections at Reggio Emilia. Children's learning is improved
					when they interact, participate, and contribute to each other's learning, learning
					alongside, with, and about each other while creating their knowledge and forming
					their working theories about their environment through group social learning
					experiences. The relationships between children and their peers and between
					children and their instructors aid in co-constructive learning by providing
					possibilities for ideas to emerge from cognitive conflict (Arseven, 2014).</p></dd>
					<dt><p>3. The Child's Image:</P></dt>
					<dd><p>The Reggio Emilia philosophy believes that all children are competent, inquiring,
					creative, and capable. Exploring their hobbies and curiosity might help them get a
					better comprehension and a stronger drive to learn. Teachers are aware of each
					child's potential and are responsible for assisting and guiding them throughout
					their educational journey (Arseven, 2014).</p></dd>
					<p>4. A Holistic Approach: Creativity:</p></dt>
					<dd><p>All of a child's learning experiences revolve around creativity. It is a technique of
					thinking, understanding, and making decisions that can be exhibited in every
					learning situation. Children are supported and encouraged to find and experience
					a variety of methods to communicate their thoughts, ideas, and creativity through
					their "hundred languages" since creativity is at the heart of the Reggio approach.
					By recognising and embracing children as individuals with preferred methods of
					learning and expression, the enriching potential of this creative and holistic
					approach to learning develops children's self-awareness and sense of identity in
					positive ways (Arseven, 2014).</p></dd>
					<dt><p>5. The learning environment as a third teacher:</p></dt>
					<dd><p>The school, classrooms, and common areas all play an essential part in the ReggioInspired approach. The environment is recognised as the third teacher, and it
					should be considered a mirror of the child's image, not simply the children,
					teachers, or parents. A Reggio-inspired school's classrooms are considered living
					organisms designed to encourage creative inquiry while also fostering contact and
					communication. Open, inviting settings with natural furniture, real-life materials,
					mirrors, windows, and natural lighting characterise Reggio-inspired classrooms
					(Robson, 2016).</p></dd>
					<dt><p>6. Documentation:</p></dt>
					<dd><p>Reggio's approach to understanding young children's learning is based on
					documentation, an essential aspect of the learning and teaching process.
					Educators exhibit a 'pedagogy of listening' to children and ways of valuing and
					supporting them as people as they make sense of their environment by watching,
					interpreting, and recording their learning process. Documentation emphasizes the
					learning process and how students acquire, process, organize and develop
					information rather than a product-focused pedagogy (Arseven, 2014).</p></dd>
					<dt><p>7. Learning dispositions and skills:</p></dt>
					<dd><p>As children are empowered to require more prominent possession and obligation
					for their learning, dispositions and abilities for deep-rooted learning are developed
					and created alongside their working hypotheses. Through problem-solving, trial
					and error, and learning to approach and work through self-set or unanticipated
					issues all through the learning process, children develop the capacity to create
					strength. Children are also given the adaptability to investigate their interests,
					make choices, and alter the course of their learning, which helps them handle risk
					and responsibility and develop arranging abilities (Arseven, 2014).</p></dd>

				<h5>Period of Conception:</h5>
				<dl>
					<dt><p>1960-1963</p></dt>
					<dd><p>In 1860, the Reggio Emilia department of the Italian charitable financial affiliation Sacro Monte di
					Pietà made a preschool for poor children in Reggio Emilia. Within the town of Villa Gaida, the district
					of Reggio Emilia made a metropolitan preschool in 1913, a typical school that provided physical and
					ethical instruction for children and preschool instruction (Cagliari et al., 2016). The Fascist
					organization concluded this standard metropolitan preschool program in 1938 (Reggio Emilia
					Approach, n.d.).</p></dd>
					<dt><p>1963</p></dt>
					<dd><p>The Robinson Preschool was the first scuola dell'infanzia/preschool for children aged 3-6 years old,
					founded by the municipality of Reggio Emilia, followed by the Anna Frank Preschool in 1964. Loris
					Malaguzzi, an educationalist and pedagogist, was involved in the new educational initiative (Cagliari,
					et.al, 2016).</p></dd>
					<dt><p>1971</p></dt>
					<dd><p>During the 1970s, Loris Malaguzzi, the mayor, city officer for schools, and the municipal cabinet,
					developed infant-toddler centres for children aged 0-3 (Thornton and Brunton, 2014). The first
					infant-toddler Centre, dedicated to Genoeffa Cervi, the mother of seven brothers in the Italian
					Resistance killed by Fascists, opened in 1971, just before Italy approved laws allowing towns to build
					infant-toddler centres across the country. The new rulebook, which lays out Reggio Emilia's
					municipal preschools' instructional content and organisational structures, was unanimously
					accepted by the local city council in 1972 (Reggio Emilia Approach, n.d.).</p></dd>
					<dt><p>1981</p></dt>
					<dd><p>After 1987, the Hundred Languages of Children exhibition in Reggio Emilia included a collection of
					educational projects created by municipal infant-toddler centres and preschools. The display, which
					toured the world in many iterations, testifies to the ongoing research process that underpins the
					entire educational initiative. In addition, it helped establish a network of international ties that grew
					in length and diversity over time (Heineman, 2022).</p></dd>
					<dt><p>1991</p></dt>
					<dd><p>The Diana municipal preschool in Reggio Emilia, which represents all of the city's infant-toddler
					centres and preschools, was named the world's most advanced early childhood education by the
					American weekly magazine Newsweek (Stremmel, 2012).</p></dd>
					<dt><p>1994</p></dt>
					<dd><p>Loris Malaguzzi passed this year. Reggio Children, an international centre for the defence and
					promotion of children's rights and potentials, was founded by the Reggio Emilia municipality.
					Through the volunteer effort of its stakeholders, the International Association of Friends of Reggio
					Children was founded at the same time, promoting, and working on projects with infant-toddler
					centres and preschools, as well as Reggio Children (Thornton and Brunton, 2014)</p></dd>
					<dt><p>2003</p></dt>
					<dd><p>On the 40th anniversary of founding the first preschools, Robinson and Anna Frank, the municipality
					launched a new initiative called the Istituzione of Preschools and Infant-toddler Centres to oversee
					educational services (Reggio Emilia Approach, n.d.).</p></dd>
					<dt><p>2006</p></dt>
					<dd><p>The Loris Malaguzzi International Centre, a project formed from Loris Malaguzzi's vision to valorise
					creativity in children of all ages, was inaugurated. Furthermore, with the founding of the Reggio
					Children International Network, international contacts became more formalized (Thornton and
					Brunton, 2014).</p></dd>
					<dt><p>2011</p></dt>
					<dd><p>The Worldwide Affiliation of Companions of Reggio Children got to be the Fondazione Reggio
					Children - Centro Loris Malaguzzi on September 29, to progress instructive brilliance in Reggio Emilia
					over the globe utilizing the essential topics of investigation, internationality, and solidarity (Rinaldi,
					2021).</p></dd>
					<dt><p>2012</p></dt>
					<dd><p>This year, the Loris Malaguzzi Universal Centre was completed. The Centre, which opened in 2006, is
					a proclamation of the Reggio Emilia Approach and provides a purposely social place for investigation
					and growth and the creation of a modern culture of children and humanity, driven by the beliefs of
					diverse characteristics and conversation. In collaboration with the Istituzione of Preschools and
					Infant-Toddler Centres and the Fondazione Reggio Children - Centro Loris Malaguzzi, Reggio Children
					manages the Malaguzzi Centre (Rinaldi, 2021).</p></dd>

				<h5>Key strategies for:</h5>
				<dl>
				<dt><p><b><u>Teaching</u></b></p></dt> 
					<dd><p>listen to the children, observe their engagement, and document their learning. In this model teachers will guide and help other students to explore their own interest where children are provided with variety of opportunities to express themselves (Bucher, 2020). To build a strong relationship between the children and educators. In this model teacher will collaboratively be engaged with the children while continuously interacting and asking questions to the children rather just assigning an activity of observing (Wolfe et al., 2021). 
					Teaching children falls on the natural development of children and the relation they share with nature therefore, to promote learners in possible integration is through the children 100 language.
					<dt><p><b><u>learning-</u></b></p></dt>
					<dd><p>Reggio Emilia values children as a capable learner who are able explore and investigate their own interest. Reggio Emilia stresses on the term hundred languages of children that illustrate that children have different avenues for thinking, constructing, negotiating, developing, revising, and expressing their thoughts, emotions and feelings (Kaynak et al., 2021). </p></dd>
					<dt><p><b><u>assessment</u></b></p></dt>
					<dd><p>The core principle of Reggio Emilia in regard to assessment is to make children learning and thinking visual. Teachers are more engaging with the children rather than only displaying the finished artworks. Teachers are able to choose variety of assessment techniques while documenting children engagement, collecting work sample, video recording (Heineman, 2022). The key concept of assessment in Reggio Emilia Approach is the 100 language of children. This describes that every child is different, and one method of teaching or learning is not suitable to each child as each child is different and adapts to different learning process (lnan, 2021).</p></dd>
					<dt><p><b><u>Planning</u></b></p></dt>
					<dd><p>Teacher will facilitate children learning through planning activity base on the interest of the children whilst using strategies like questioning to understand the children level of knowledge and being actively engaged with the child instead of being a passively observing the children in their play. Most of the learning that occurs take in the form of project where children have opportunities to actively engage, take participation, questioning, and exploring the new learning resources (Fochi, 2022).</p></dd>
					<dt><p><b><u>Reflection</u></b></p></dt>
					<dd><p>Reflection is an essential element in improvising on their own practices and taking time to honour both the teacher and child. Teachers must reflect on their everyday practices on how we as an educator could do better and be more inspired. Teachers are not just teaching or guiding the children but providing a learning experience therefore it is essential to reflect on how educators can continuously improve. Teachers take on some time to stop, challenge, change, and think on their ongoing teaching practices or environment for the children and further incorporate an appropriate practices or approaches that best suits the need of the child (Sorzio & Campbell-Barr, 2019).</p></dd>

				<h5>Goals and outcomes:</h5>
				<p>The goal of Reggio Emilia’s hundred language of children for educators and children is to have a better understanding of one another. The aim of this approach is to teach children how they would be able to use the symbolic languages for instance, sculpting, drama, painting and more (Aljabreen, 2020). The outcome of Reggio Emilia approach is through engaging children in a meaningful experience, it helps the learners to enhances their early education while preparing the children for transition into the schools (Heckman et al., 2017). Further children will be able to engage in community and environment, accept challenges, building social and emotional skills while being able to express their feelings and emotions with confidence and enjoy their learning based on their interest. A relaxed learning surrounding for the children that encourages self-exploration. Through child lead approached it will allow children to have access to consistent opportunities for problem-solving and developing their cognitive skills (Fischer et al., 2020). </p>

				<h5>Position on play:</h5>
				<p> 
					<br>	Malaguzzi's theory comprises three essential principles that form the basis of the Reggio Emilia Approach, one of which is play, and is a crucial component of children's learning and development.
					<br>	The Reggio Emilia approach emphasises the use of play as a learning tool. Children's interest, inquiries, and the world in which they live guide play. The play resources supplied contribute meaningfully to the children's play. Children's ability to design their own plays and discoveries assists in the development of autonomy and creativeness (Ebbeck & Waniganayake, 2017). 
					<br>	As children direct their own play, social interactions occur and relationships are developed.  Language is thrived, science and maths are examined, creativeness and arts go hand - in - hand, nature is incorporated across many play settings and discoveries, and the cultures of others is meaningfully experienced (Ebbeck & Waniganayake, 2017).
					<br>	 Children are fully immersed in their play. Educators use provocations to inspire debate, investigation, experimentation, curiosity, and understanding after observing the children. Provocations are focused on topics that the children are interested in (McCormick Smith & Cho, 2018).
					<br>	Provocation can be a concept i.e. change, a problem i.e. children touching chrysalises and engaging them, an object i.e. a map, questions from the children and teacher, an event, a book and nature e.g. children’s fascination with trees (Edwards & Gandini, 2018). 
					<br>	 Educators builds on to the play and discovery on topics after children initiate an investigation or research by arranging and facilitating meaningful plans in separate areas of the classroom (Edwards & Gandini, 2018). 
					<br>	Reggio Emilia model views child's third teacher as the teaching environment. Each area does have an individuality and a role, so it must be full of opportunities for participation and advance children's play and learning (Lino & Parente, 2018).  
					<br>	Environments are meant to foster inclusivity and social connections, engagement with a variety of resources, as well as accessibility to the outdoor and the local communities (Lino & Parente, 2018).

				<h5>The role of the program model on the provision of early childhood education across the globe:</h5>
				<p> 
					How could a little town in Northern Italy have shaped educational perspectives in several countries? Since its inception in the 1940s, this early childhood education programme concept has been used by early childhood educators all over the world. Numerous preschools are using a child-led curriculum based on the Reggio Emilia Approach. It is now usual practise to tailor educator's curriculum to the individual interests of the children in classroom. For example, if numerous children develop an interest in sea creatures, opportunities to strengthen maths, critical thinking, and language abilities can be built around this specific subject.
					<br>
						The influence of Reggio Emilio model on the provision of early childhood education in south America
					<br>
					Unites states<br>
					The Reggio Emilia approach of early childhood education thrived the children who came from the most challenging and disadvantaged pre-schools in United states. The Model Early Learning Center (MELC) in Washington, DC is one of such pre-schools. This varied preschool shows that children and families in need can thrive if their strengths are supported and valued, with the support from Amelia Gambetti, who is the international Reggio liaison (Emerson & Linder, 2021). She stayed at the MELC for a year to help educators comprehend the Reggio Approach. Encouraging families in becoming active in their children's education was among the most challenging jobs that she faced during the year. The educators require families' involvement to fully understand the children, as well as demonstrate the children realize their parents are part of educational structure, not just because they ought to be instructed by the educators. Educators tried to replicate a variety of techniques to make parents interested but were unsuccessful. Only after educators had the children to write hand written notes to their parents asking their assistance and participation, made the parents decide to support and give their time (Emerson & Linder, 2021). The parents were welcomed and regarded a crucial component of their children's life at school since their first encounter at the school. Parents were not being evaluated, but rather valued of what they were and the crucial part they play in their child’s life (Emerson & Linder, 2021). Furthermore, the National Center for Children in Poverty (NCCP) (n.d.) discovered some intriguing results that highlight the need of delivering a curriculum based on early children's social-emotional development. By adopting programmes for young children which promote socio-emotional skills, the probability of these children acquiring mental illnesses as adults is significantly lowered. Furthermore, studies have also shown that high-quality preschools have a beneficial, considerable influence on the lifestyle and development of the children (Sattar & Taimur, 2019). Children who are enrolled in a preschool that supports both emotional and cognitive development are much more likely to be living and leading a healthier life (Sattar, 2019). These reflects on the values which form Reggio Emilia philosophy and therefore have impacted the educational views of educators, teachers, principals and administrators in United States.

						The influence of Reggio Emilio model on the provision of early childhood education in South America
					The Reggio Emilia Philosophy has reached and inspired numerous countries in South America. Red SOLARE is the Latin-American association that supports and disseminates this philosophy in Argentina, Paraguay, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Costa Rica, Chile, Ecuador, Guatemala, Dominican Republic, Uruguay and Venezuela. 
					<br>
					Brazil<br>
					Red SOLARE Brazil (RSB) is a network for the coordination and dissemination of ideas on the educational practice of Reggio Emilia, in defence of a world of childhood culture from an integral perspective, integrated with real exchanges between Brazilian states and Latin American countries. It is an association of institutions and individuals, and non-profit organizations, which recognizes social responsibility as a duty of all. This organization provides teachers and schools with opportunities to participate in conferences and seminars to learn more about this philosophy and how to implement its values into their own schools. The Red SOLARE Brazil 2015 conference was held in Bahia on October 16th and 17th. The conference was based on the theme of “Children, Nature of Languages and each of us: Connections and Relationships to Reggio Emilia”. This conference focused on the elements that inspire creative educators’ processes: childhood and nature. This website also offers professional publications for purchase (Red SOLARE Brazil, 2015). 
					<br>
					Colombia<br>
					Colombia Red SOLARE Colombia (RSC) includes individuals, institutions and educational and social projects, and non-profit organizations with representation in Barranquilla, Medellin, Cali, and Bogota. Its mission is to create a network among its members to develop communication, cooperation and exchange of experience, research, and theories, and to always generate many new dialogues on the role of children in education, culture, and society (Red SOLARE Colombia, 2015). Red SOLARE Colombia focuses on four branches: 
					1.	Projects, institutions, and individuals inspired by the Reggio Emilia philosophy, who recognize and demonstrate the influence of the philosophy’s fundamental values in its methods of working with children. 
					2. Dissemination and organization of events, conferences, workshops, etc., with the purpose of publicizing and broadening the perspective of the Reggio Emilia philosophy and its culture for children. 
					3. Educational research projects, institutions and individuals working with a continuous investigation on the cognitive, physical, and social-emotional development of children. Furthermore, sharing the results of these research experiences as a common good of pedagogy and the value of childhood is highly encouraged. 
					4. Community engagement to attempt to investigate methods and solutions to work with vulnerable populations.
					<br>
						The influence of Reggio Emilio model on the provision of early childhood education in Europe
					<br>
					Sweden<br>
					The Reggio Emilia School in Sweden provides a variety of training options. Its programme is available to everyone. The programme is broken into two parts: Around the Country and Stockholm (Foerch & Iuspa, 2016).  Furthermore, it offers possibilities for professional advancement at the early childhood setting and school premises, demanding the training thru the programme Corporate Education. This organisation also acts as a bridge among Swedish groups interested in participating seminars and training courses in Reggio Emilia, Italy's childcare and school systems (Foerch & Iuspa, 2016). Such courses are primarily comprised of the regular weekly seminars in Reggio Emilia. It also offers extensive courses, Atelierista, Pedagogista and Educator, as well as gives details on specialized training for Pedagogista, that started in January 2016 (The Reggio Emilia Institute in Sweden, 2015).
					<br>
						The influence of Reggio Emilio model on the provision of early childhood education in AFRICA
					<br>
					South Africa<br>
					Leading to variations in its educational system, Africa has shown resurgence of interest in using the Reggio Emilia approach. An exemplar of such an implementation can be seen at South Africa's St. Mary's School. The school is an autonomous school for girls, with programmes ranging from infancy (known as Little Saints) to senior year (Foerch & Iuspa, 2016). The interaction between both the child and the educator becomes an important component of teaching at the Little Saints level. Educators are held in great regard and engage in an intellectual discussion with children in accordance to school’s website (St. Mary’s Diocesan School for girls, n.d.). Using engaged listening, they provide opportunities for exploration and participate with children in their joy as well as interest in constructing, investigating, and learning (Foerch & Iuspa, 2016).  It exemplifies the Reggio Emilia model of educators and children working together to learn.
					A much greatest impact of the Reggio Emilia approach is shown in Little Saints grades 000 and 00, at the levels of project designed by educators focused on the children's interest (St. Mary’s Diocesan School for girls, n.d.). Simultaneously, several areas of the imagination, cognition, atelier, library, and gardening sectors often facilitates opportunities for children's physically, socio-emotionally, artistically, intellectually, and spiritually i.e., holistic development.

				<h5>The influence of Reggio Emilio model on the provision of early childhood education in Australia:</h5>
				<p> 
					Whilst Reggio Emilia concept is well-known around the world, it has only been in past 10 years when Early Childhood educators in Australia have been introduced methodologically. In 1992, Jan Millikan, renowned author of Reflections: Reggio Emilia Principles within Australian Contexts, first organised several professional seminars at the Australian Early Childhood Association bi-annual conference (Hall, 2013). Also, in 1995, Millikan was formally introduced as the Reggio Emilia Liaison for New Zealand and Australia by Reggio Children following her trips to the United States and to Reggio Emilia in 1990 (Hall, 2013). With her advocacy efforts, many Australian educators and international attendees on her conferences and seminars were influenced and the model was started to be accepted in the educational system of Australia.
					More modern concepts about children's development and learning are based on Reggio Emilia's philosophical leanings as well as sociocultural theory (Hall, 2013). The Australian Early Years Learning Framework, which emphasises this theoretical approach, reflects this notion of transformation (Department of Education, Employment, Workplace and Relation, 2009a). This is a rethinking of early childhood education, with a focus on how educators engage with children in order to assist their learning. It also emphasises the significance of the socio-cultural background in growth. According to Anning et al. (2009), the Reggio Emilia concepts have indeed been implemented in certain child care centres, albeit mostly in the private schools. Such Reggio Emilio model can be found adopted by the educators at Canberra's Wiradjuri Preschool and Child Care Centre build their teaching on the notion of the rich and strong child, that is related with Reggio Emilia approaches to early childhood education that emphasise the strength of learning alongside others (ECA, 2011). The Centre also exhibits a sense of social responsibility by demonstrating reverence for Aboriginal land custodians as well as the rights of each child and parents to feel a greater sense of belonging and inclusiveness.
					Reggio Emilia approach to early education portrays child’s image as a citizen with rights and potential. It believes all children are strong, powerful, and capable learners regardless of their cultural diversity, family background, and personal traits (Australian Children’s Education & Care Quality Authority [ACECQA], 2018). This encourages teachers to held high expectation for the learning and development of each child and support their individual learning path. It believes that children learn through active social constructive processes and emphasis on the idea of “participation”. It recognizes the importance of solidarity and encourages children’s learning through group participation in collaboration with their peers, teachers, families, and communities. It advocates for the inclusive practices, diversity, solidarity, and shared responsibility in the service through the participation of children, families, and communities. It creates welcoming environment for diverse culture in the service (Early Childhood Australia, n.d.). 
					Furthermore, current theory and study influenced by the Reggio Emilia method appreciate and acknowledge the environment as a third teacher. It includes physical components if the space such as types of furniture, resources, lighting, and architecture (Early Childhood Australia, n.d.). Likewise, it also emphasis on the relational aspects of the space such as providing physical and social comfort through the space, arrangement of furniture according to the suitability of the people, engagement with the space, and space for children’s and parents’ input in the space for supporting children’s holistic development (Early Childhood Australia, n.d.). 
					Well-maintained environment with supporting resources and cultural inclusiveness promotes psychological wellbeing, sense of belonging, and fun and familiar learning space for children. Inclusive environments acknowledge the individuality of each child considering the age, interests, preferences, strengths, abilities, and learning styles of a child and supports their learning and development by providing appropriate learning experiences (Australian Children’s Education & Care Quality Authority [ACECQA], 2018). As well as fosters positive social relationships of children with their peers, teachers, families, and communities. 
					The quality Area 3 of the National Quality Standard emphasises the need of creating sustainable and inclusive learning settings which enhance and foster children's learning (NQS) especially area 3.2: The early childhood service environment is welcoming, supportive, and encourages discovery and play-based learning. 
					Element 3.2.1: Outdoors and indoors setting are designed and adjusted to support and involve each child in high-quality experiences in both constructed and natural contexts (ACEQUA, 2018a).
					Element 3.2.2: Resources, tools, and equipment may be used for numerous purposes, are accessible, and enable each child to participate in play-based learning (ACEQUA, 2018a).
					Standard 3.2.3: The service care for the environment and promotes children into becoming environmentally conscious. (ACEQUA, 2018a). 
					•	Likewise, Reggio Emilia approach highly emphasis on the relationships between children, teachers, families, and communities and believes relationships are the foundations of learning (Follari, 2015). This believe is practiced in daily curriculum of Australian early childhood education as relationships between the stakeholders are very important for supporting the holistic development and learning of children (ACECQA, 2018). 

					•	Teachers and families are the most essential partners in children’s learning. The teachers stimulate children’s learning by using various intentional teaching strategies such as open-ended questions, role modelling, collaborating, facilitating with learning resources, and extending thinking and observing children’s progress (Follari, 2015; ACECQA, 2018). 

					•	Reggio Emilia approach focuses on the documentation of children’s learning to make learning visible as well as build a understandings of children’s initial knowledge, interest, abilities, and use them as provocation for future planning (Follari, 2015). 

					Reggio Emilia view art and beauty as the foundations for the educational environment. Learning environments that are staggeringly pleasing, represent the individuality of families and children, and inspire a link to environment connect and build a sense of belonging and respect. As a result, the physical environment is never just a background to the curricula but is an essential component of the curriculum or experiences (DWEER, 2009b). A classroom environment that is rich in learning possibilities also allows educators to engage with children. The following are some features of engaging environments:
					•	Interesting things such as natural materials
					•	Open-ended materials
					•	Balance of experiences
					•	Flexible access
					•	Recycling and re-purposing 
												(ACEQUA, 2018b)
					This is consistent with the Reggio philosophy, as Reggio-inspired schools are aimed to foster connections, communication, and cooperation via play. Additionally, classroom supplies are carefully chosen to promote imagination, problem-solving work, exploration, discovery, and open-ended play (Edward & Gandini, 2018).
